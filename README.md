# hello-world
Familiarizing myself with github so that I might contribute to the HR RPT student wiki, and other future projects. 

Hello! This tutorial asked me to write a bit about myself. I am a creatively-driven, open, thoughtful person. I love my friends, but struggle to stay in touch. I have a dog named Tyson that I take hiking and to different places around the city. I cook and eat as a way to practice mindfulness. I hope to write a book someday, or write for television, or just write. I'm currently working on a poem, and on learning a little bit about github.
